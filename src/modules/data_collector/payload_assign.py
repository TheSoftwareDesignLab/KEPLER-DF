    Stochastically configures and binds physical payload subsystems to a pool of raw satellite assets.

    Iterates through a cluster of hardware configurations to dynamically assign core operational bounds,
    including discrete downlink communication frequencies, localized data transmission data rates, solid-state 
    storage capacity thresholds, and unique, non-overlapping instrument suites. Allocation frequencies are 
    fully controlled by parameterized relative probability density distributions.

    Args:
        satellites: Collection of raw satellite configuration instances awaiting physical payload mapping.
        available_sensors: Complete pool registry of instruments supported across the current factory run.
        available_bands: Fleet-wide list of active RF communication bands to draw from.
        available_capacities: Pool of discrete on-board memory limits modeling Solid-State Recorders.
        capacities_weights: Probability density array dictating on-board memory storage pool selections.
        sensor_weights: Probability density array controlling the relative distribution frequency of instruments.
        band_weights: Probability density array dictating frequency allocations across the selected tracking pool.
        sensor_generation_rates: Mapping dictionary linking discrete instrument strings to unique payload data generation rates.
        band_downlink_rates: Mapping dictionary linking RF transmission band tags to nominal streaming speeds.
        min_sensors_per_sat: Minimum number of independent instruments assigned to each active hardware bus.
        max_sensors_per_sat: Maximum number of independent instruments assigned to each active hardware bus.
        seed: Fixed pseudo-random initialization anchor used to guarantee experimental simulation reproducibility.

    Returns:
        A list of fully enriched satellite platform structures with populated and calibrated payload properties.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If hardware infrastructure resource pools are empty, or if sensor allocation bounds 
            violate operational constraints.
